\section{Research Question} % Begin chapter
Do different genres receive varying critical appreciation? We compare 3 movie genres (`Comedy', `Documentary', `Drama') with their ratings (`Rotten', `Fresh', `Certified Fresh') to determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between the two variables.

\section{Analysis}
The tables below provide the joint distribution of raw values (Figure \ref{tab:tab}) and conditional distributions of proportions (Table \ref{tab:prob_tab}). The  conditional distributions in Table \ref{tab:prob_tab}  show non-identical distributions of ratings according to genre. The probability of ``Rotten'' conditional on the movie being a comedy is ...., while the probability of ``Rotten'' conditional on the movie being a documentary is only.... This is a first indication that genre and ratings are not independent.

\begin{tabular}{lcccc} 
\hline
Genre/rating & Rotten & Fresh & Certified Fresh & Sum \\ 
\hline
Comedy & 0.72 & 0.16 & 0.11 &1.0 \\ 
Documentary & 0.06 & 0.62 &  0.33 & 1.0 \\
Drama & 0.41 & 0.35 & 0.25 &1.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

We also visualize the results in Table \ref{tab:prob_tab} in Figure \ref{fig:barplot}, which  confirms that the probability of ``Rotten'' varies greatly depending on the genre.

Finally, we us the Chi-square test of independence to validate whether genre and ratings are independent or not. The code used is detailed below:

\begin{verbatim}
# Run Chi squared test
chisq.test(df_s$genre, df_s$critics_rating)
\end{verbatim}

The results of the test were as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  df_s$genre and df_s$critics_rating
X-squared = 62.008, df = 4, p-value = 1.097e-12
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we rejected the null hypothesis that ranking and genre are  independent. In particular, we note that Comedy seems to be more likely to receive rotten reviews, while documentaries are less likely to receive rotten reviews.
